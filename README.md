1.	Summary of the Analysis
In this pandas challenge, I wrote a script that analyzes the district-wide standardized test to evaluate the trends in school performance. The script has the following data for the report.
	District Summary. 
	For the District Summary report, the script first calculates the total number of unique schools, the total number of students, the budget, and the average math and reading scores. It then checks the percentage of students who passed math, reading, and both. And finally, the result is shown in a data frame.
	The report shows that 15 schools with a total of 39,170 students are analyzed in this study. And the result shows that the reading percentage passing is higher than math, and the lowest is observed in the overall percentage passing. 
	
	School Summary. 
	For the School Summary report, a script I created a data frame that summarizes the school’s name, school type, the total number of students, the school budget, budget per student, average math and reading scores, and the percentage passing math, reading, and both.
	The data frame shows that the reading percentage passing is higher than math, and the lowest is observed in the overall percentage passing. 
	
	Highest-Performing School. 
	For the Highest-Performing School report,  I created a data frame that is sorted to show the highest-performing school by the overall passing percentage.
	The result shows that the top five highest-performing classes have an average per-student budget between $578 and $638, with the total number of students varying between 962 and 2283.
	
	Lowest-Performing School. 
	For the Lowest-Performing School report, I created a data frame that is sorted to show the lowest-performing school by the overall passing percentage.
	The result shows that the bottom five low-performing classes have an average per-student budget between $637 and $655, with the total student number varying between 2,917 and 4,761.
	
	Math Scores by Grade. 
	For the Math Scores by Grade report, I created a data frame that lists the average math scores for each grade-level student.
	We don’t see a significant math score variation between grades from the data frame.
	
	Reading Scores by Grade. 
	For the Reading Scores by Grade report, I created a data frame that lists the average reading scores for each grade-level student.
	We don’t observe a significant reading score variation between grades from the data frame.
	
	
	Scores by School Spending. 
	For the Scores by School Spending report, I created a data frame that breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges per student.
	This report indicates that higher grades are observed in schools with the lowest budget per student
	
	Scores by School Size. 
	For the Scores by School Size report, I created a data frame that breaks down school performance based on School size.
	From this report, schools with a small number of students have higher performance in math and reading.
	
	Scores by School Type. 
	For the Scores by School Type report, I created a data frame that shows school performance based on School type.
	This report indicates that charter schools perform better than districts.
	
	
2.	Conclusion
Compiling the report data, we can conclude the following.
I.	Schools with lower per-student budgets perform better, Meaning increasing the student budget is not helping the school achieve better results. 
II.	Schools with a small number of students perform better.
